### Repo-names_are_hard_when_many_repo-names_already_taken

* A personal game project.
* Nothing is final, learning things as I go.
* Made with Python and Pygame Community Edition.
* Eventually this project should incorporate PyOpenGL too.
* At least one commit a day, ad-infinitum, therefore the project will get completed.

_I **[still]** don't know how to use GitHub or Git, lmfao._
